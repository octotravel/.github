![OCTO - Simplifying Connectivity for Tours, Activities & Attractions]() 

[OCTO](https://www.octo.travel/) (Open Connectivity for Tours, Activities, and Attractions) is an open standard API specification for the in-destination experiences sector of the travel industry. The standard defines agreed-upon schemas, endpoints, and capabilities commonly needed when connecting platforms, resellers, OTAs, and other technologies in tours, activities, and attractions. 

**The OCTO API Specification is Opensource** and available to anyone who wants to use it. You do not need to be a member to use this specification in your business. If, however, you would like to support OCTO and have a voice in how the specification evolves, please consider [becoming a member](https://www.octo.travel/join).
